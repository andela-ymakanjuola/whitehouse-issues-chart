I did some more investigation and noticed that the problem went away (my signatures went through) after I temporarily re-enabled the Referer header (I usually browse with that off), and so the problem seems to be caused by the site rejecting AJAX requests without Referer headers (though I wouldn't be surprised if there are a few other conditions that will lead to the same behavior). The site should show some kind of error message when requests fail for reasons like this so that users can tell that they've failed."

As part of my current research, I'm studying the implications of open-sourcing a proprietary software, for instance, if the project succeed in attracting newcomers. However, I observed that some projects, like _petitions_, deleted their software history when transitioning to open-source.\n\nhttps://github.com/WhiteHouse/petitions/commit/5733575c4fe85c9f8ea0a7db9fa38d3f2d339fc0\n\nKnowing that software history is indispensable for developers (e.g., developers need to refer to history several times a day), I would like to ask petitions developers the following four brief questions:\n1. Why did you decide to not keep the software history?\n2. Do the core developers faced any kind of problems, when trying to refer to the old history? If so, how did they solve these problems?\n3. Do the newcomers faced any kind of problems, when trying to refer to the old history? If so, how did they solve these problems?\n4. How does the lack of history impacted on software evolution? Does it placed any burden in understanding and evolving the software?\n\nThanks in advance for your collaboration,\n\nGustavo Pinto, PhD\nhttp://www.gustavopinto.org\n"

        "body": "I am developing an iOS app in which the user will watch/follow many petitions.  I need a way to request multiple petitions in one request for easier implementation and less network overhead on their phones and We the People's servers.\n\nIn my app, there is maintained a list of petition id's which the user is watching.  I want to be able to specify multiple id's of the petitions I want in one API request.  That way, I won't have to worry about exceeding my 10 request/second limit, and the We the People servers will not be bogged down with around 50 requests each time my users want to view their favorite petitions.  Instead, one request would be sent.\n\nAn example request may look like the following:\nhttps://api.whitehouse.gov/v1/petitions.json?&id=1234&id=5678.\n\n...or even\nhttps://api.whitehouse.gov/v1/petitions.json.&id=1234%205678\n\nThis functionality is critical to the performance of my app.\n\n**Why not just cache every petition and filter among those cached petitions?**\nI don't want to cache every single petition on the device and simply filter from among those.  Users follow petitions in order to stay up to date with petitions.  So, this doesn't make sense to cache petitions on which users want to stay up to date.  API requests will nonetheless have to be made whenever the users view their followed petitions.  So, under the current design, users will ask the We the People API for 1000-2000 petitions at once rather than ~20-100.\n\nThis seems to make sense for both the clients and We the People servers regarding network performance and optimization.\n"

Is this a possible feature for a future version? Once the module uses MySQL?\n\nRight now, I'd like to be able to download datasets from some of the current petitions for research.

Get many signatures, enough to cross the current petition threshold.\n3. Receive a letter from the White House blatantly ignoring or contradicting the factual information in the petition, and explaining the pre-existing position of the administration.\n4. Have approximately the same petition be repeated periodically, because people are still upset about the issue because the White House hasn't actually _done_ anything about the issue.\n### For example\n\nhttps://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/abolish-tsa-and-use-its-monstrous-budget-fund-more-sophisticated-less-\nintrusive-counter-terrorism/c7L94bFB?utm_source=wethepeople&utm_medium=response&utm_campaign=tsa\n\n**Petition body:**\n\n\"It has failed approximately 70% of undercover efficacy tests, and for all its excesses, has been unable to catch even a single terrorist since its creation.\"\n\n**Petition response:**\n\n\"Over the past 10 years, TSA has strengthened security by creating successful programs and deploying technologies that were not in place prior to September 11, while also taking steps whenever possible to enhance the passenger experience.\"\n"
